# Angular class for She Codes Now

I volunteered to design an introductory course on Angular for She Codes Now (class is an hour and a half). This repo will eventually become the one that students will fork and clone for the class. At present, I'm keeping my slides separate from this repo, so this will mostly be empty until I start including the exercises. Contact me if you want to see the rest of the materials or have questions.

I've been teaching for 8 years in various fields including web development, sociology, midwifery, and feminist studies (formerly women's studies). Teaching is one of the ways I learn, so when I teach I'm also learning. I believe in a peer-to-peer approach to teaching rather than the more traditional top-down approach. Everybody has something to learn from everybody else.
