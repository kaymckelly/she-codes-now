# Angular class for She Codes Now

I volunteered to design an hour and a half long workshop on Angular 1.x for [She Codes Now](https://www.meetup.com/She-Codes-Now/). At present, this repo contains related files to the course. The slides will be uploaded after the class.

I've been teaching for the better part of a decade in various fields (web development, sociology, and midwifery, to name a few). Teaching is one of the ways I learn, so when I teach I'm also learning. I believe in a peer-to-peer approach to teaching rather than the more traditional top-down approach. Everybody has something to learn from everybody else.
